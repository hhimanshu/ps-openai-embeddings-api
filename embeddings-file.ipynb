       "      <td>If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem.</td>\n",

I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.\\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Would recommend!</td>\n",

Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next.</td>\n",

The place was nice and clean. Very quiet neighborhood. He had maps and a lonely planet guide book in the room for you to use. I didnt have any trouble finding the place from Central Station. I would defintely come back! Thanks!  \n",
       "1    If you want the authentic Amsterdam houseboat experience, this is it!  It is a great boat, located on a quiet canal with a view of the Rijksmuseum towers.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed, hot shower, good wifi signal, nice kitchen with fridge, cofee maker, and stove for cooking meals.  The location is very accessible to museums, gym bar and bakery on the corner, nine streets area with lots of resaraunts and bars and jazz clubs, Vondelpark, shopping on Utrechtstraat, and all of the sites of central Amsterdam.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Now for the special part: If you are at all interested in boats and maritime history, this one is a great find.  The cabin where guests stay is actually the cargo hold within the original hull of a freight boat that once hauled goods all over Holland.  (Just imagine the countless tons of cargo that came in and out of the place where you are sleeping!)  And yet the interior beautifully and comfortably remodeled using new and salvaged materials including a number of hatches that serve as skylights.  The original steerhouse is still intact, along with the original one-cylinder engine down below.  But the highlight is the captain's quarters where the family who owned and operated the boat lived during the 1920s (not open for guests to sleep in, yet).  Stepping down into the quarters, complete with original cabinets and cookstove, feels like traveling back in time.  The host cares a lot about preserving the historical character of his boat, because most other boats like it have long since gone to the scrapyard.  He showed us fascinating photographs of the original owners who lived on the boat when it plied the canals nearly 100 years ago.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>There are many houseboats in Amsterdam.  A lot of them are glorified trailer houses on flat barges.  This one is a gem.  \n",

I couldn't recommend staying with Derk any more highly.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Coolest thing first: We showed up to Derk's and he actually had three houseboats in a row, and offered to show up the one we saw on the site and another, and let us choose our favorite to stay in!  We had an incredible boat with wired internet, a comfortable bed and a very comfortable futon, TV, speakers, hot water, a shower, washer/dryer.  I couldn't believe I was on a boat.  Plus the charm of being on one was fantastic, and the views out onto the canal were fantastic.  It rained one morning and was such a beautiful way to wake up.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>In addition, Derk was really communicative, responded to our last minute (day before!) request for a reservation quite casually, and met us right at the boat.  He even had a few cold beers in the fridge for us, and was really great explaining the area.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Would recommend!  \n",

We didn't want to stay in the typical Amsterdam hotel and opted for something special - a traditional Dutch houseboat.  Needless to say staying on a boat was a special experience, but the boat was very clean, was on a quiet canal in a superb location in central Amsterdam, and had everything we needed for a memorable weekend.  The owner was good to make some worthwhile recommendations for us and was very flexible with the boat itself (he offered us his other boat in case we preferred that one), etc.  I will definitely try to book this houseboat again when I return to Amsterdam next.  \n",

Absolute highlight of our month long trip! I had looked at a lot of houseboats, some looked like 5 star hotels but chose this because it had character. I am so glad we did. It was full of character and much more spacious than it looks. The location is fantastic, in a beautiful quiet part of town. On top of that you have Derk the host, what an absolute gem he is. Really helpful, nothing too much trouble. I cannot speak highly enough about the boat and the host. I am trying to organise another trip to Amsterdam as it is now my favourite city, and I would definitely be staying at Derk's place. Thanks Derk, hope to see you soon!!  \n",

Derk was very relaxed and welcoming & the boat is incredible!  We even found a washing machine under the stairs on day 3, which took me 10 steps closer to convincing my partner that we should live on a boat full time ;-)  \n",

I really appreciated the coffee and tea  who were available. We stayed there with 5 adults (not couples) and some beds were maybe quite small but okay. Daan was very flexible to meet and hand the keys and to help with all special needs from my colleagues :-)...   \n",
       "70   Our experience was amazing! In first, the boat is located in perfect place, near subway and moorings of most popular touristic boat lines. It is really center of Amsterdam. Next advantage is facilities on the boat. At morning you can make a cup of coffee and enjoy it on the boat stern looking at canal and nice buildings and bridge. And finally, just in a few hours you'll have great skill of entering inside boat through the small door :-)   \n",

My favorite moment of the trip was waking up in the morning and having coffee outside on the boat, watching the ducks play in the canal and the view of the Rijksmuseum in the distance. Tip: It's much cheaper to take a tram from Centraal Station than a taxi. Derk was a great host, and very attentive to what we needed!   \n",

       "6   Location is Perfect with-in walking distance of Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum, Heineken museum, Dam square, Waterlooplein market and of course Jordaan’s charming lanes.  (hire a bike from around the corner, travel one side of the city to the other in minutes!) \\r<br/>Every corner you turn has something to offer. \\r<br/>The boat is moored on a quite, peaceful, picturesque canal. Cafe, restaurants, bars, supermarket and shops all minutes away.\\r<br/>Derk is such a nice guy, he was extremely helpful and is so laid back. His home is yours and you feel very welcome.\\r<br/>The boat is charming, clean and comfortable (we got a choice of boats, which ever suited us best!)  Instant running hot water, wifi, cooker the lot all you need for a comfy stay.\\r<br/>We took our 2.5yr old with us and she felt she was in a fairytale, sleeping on a boat, she got up each morning to feed the swans and ducks from the boat, and then later swam naked with all the other toddlers in Vondelpark fountains.\\r<br/>We left planing our next stay, so I really can not recommend this holiday anymore, it was perfect. If you want a unique, unforgettable experience then go for this boat.    \n",

It was clean and spacious for two people and had all necessary amenities (and more!) to comfortably stay for a few days.  The location was great, 15 minute walk to downtown and red light district, bike rentals right around the corner, 5 minutes to grocery store, yet still in a quiet neighborhood. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Derk was a great host as well.  He was there waiting for us when we arrived and made sure we could hook up to wifi and had all of his contact info in case we had to reach him.  He was a really friendly guy- even left us a couple beers in the fridge.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>We highly recommend staying here!\\r<br/>   \n",
